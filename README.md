## Welcome to DIT094 (Team Programming) - Group 2 repository

This repository contains the source code of the project developed by Group 2 for the course DIT094 (Team Programming), Software Engineering and Management, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, a joint department between Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg.

The project was fairly simple, it is a recreation of the classic game "Snake" using the Java programming language. The game is developed using the JavaFX library for the graphical user interface.

Given that the course was the second programming course of the program, the project was developed by a group of students with little to no experience in software development. Therefore, the project is lacking in proper Git workflow, code quality, etc.

However, the main focus of the project was not the game itself, but the development process. The project was developed following agile methodologies. Along with the project, there is a project management report, which was the main deliverable of the course. The report contains the documentation of the development process, including the planning, the development, the testing, and the final delivery of the project.

Furthermore, the project was developed using the Git version control system, and the project was hosted on Chalmers GitLab, therefore the repository might be missing features such as the issues and the merge requests, which are not available in GitHub.
